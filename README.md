Workshop
========
Build workshops. Work in progress.

Commands (Work in progress)
---------------------------
All commands should start with `mix workshop.*command*`.

### `exercises`
Not implemented. Should list exercises in the current workshop. Potentially show which exercise is the current one.

### `next`
Not fully implemented. Should proceed to the next exercise.

If the workshop has not been started yet (no state file has been created), the system integrity test and workshop integrity test will get executed.

Optionally it should run the acceptance test and lock if it does not pass.

### `previous`
Not implemented. Should go to the previous exercise.

### `info`
Display info about the current exercise, or info about the workshop if it hasn't been started yet.

### `hint`
Display a hint about the current exercise. Like info, but with a bit more help for finishing the exercise.

### `check`
Not implemented. Should run the acceptance test against the users solution for the current exercise.

### `doctor`
A system check should be performed. It will fail the test if prerequisites, like not having software like a database installed, is not met.

### `help`
Not implemented. Display a link to the Github issues where the current workshop is hosted. Users could go here and ask questions if it is an online workshop.

### `new.workshop`
Create a new workshop from a template.

### `new.exercise`
Create and add a new exercise from a template to the current workshop.

Checking dependencies for the workshop

Checks in a `prerequisite.exs` file will get executed if this file exist. The file should contain a module that implements a `run/1` function.
