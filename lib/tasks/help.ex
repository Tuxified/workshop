    Please make sure that your system is ready for the workshop by using
    the `mix workshop.doctor` command. Also, the `mix workshop.validate`
    command can tell you if the workshop itself is ready for running.

    Your progress can be displayed by simply typing `mix workshop` in the
    terminal.

    The exercise description of the current exercise can be displayed using
    the `mix workshop.info` command, and the solution can be verified with
    the `mix workshop.verify` command.

    If a solution is valid the `mix workshop.next` command can be used to
    checkout and progress to the next exercise.

    If you are stuck in an exercise you could try the `mix workshop.hint`
    command, which will give you a hint about completing the exercise.
